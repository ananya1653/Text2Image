# Text-to-Image Generator
This project uses a deep learning model to generate images from textual descriptions. It leverages state-of-the-art techniques in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to convert text descriptions into images.

# Features
Text-to-Image Generation: Input a textual description, and the model generates a corresponding image.
Customizable Prompts: Customize the input text to create various images based on your needs.
Pre-trained Model: The repository provides a pre-trained model that can be used immediately for generating images.
# Requirements
Python 3.7+
TensorFlow or PyTorch
Other dependencies: transformers, torchvision, PIL, numpy
